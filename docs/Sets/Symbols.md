<blockquote>
<p><strong>Semiotics</strong> is the study of signs and sign processing. It explores how meaning is created and communicated through symbols and signs.</p>

<h1>🔍 Worst Cases</h1>
<p>When determining a logical strategy that is guaranteed to succeed, it's crucial to analyze the <strong>worst case</strong>. By preparing for the worst-case scenario we ensure reliability and robustness in logical reasoning and problem-solving.</p>

<h1>🎯 Symbology and Semiotics</h1>
<p>In mathematics and logic, we use specific symbols to express clear, precise meanings:</p>


Symbol | Meaning | Example/Explanation
-- | -- | --
$A := B$ <br> $B =: A$ | "A is defined to be B"; "A is defined by B" | Defines equivalence or a definition.
∀ | "for all"; "for every" | $∀x∈\mathbb{N}$, meaning "for every x belonging to natural numbers."
∃ | "there exists" | ∃x, meaning "there exists at least one x."
¬S | Negation of statement S; "it is not the case that S" | ¬(x>0) means "it is not true that x is greater than 0."
a∈A | Element "a" belongs to set A | $3∈\mathbb{N}$ means "3 is an element of natural numbers."
∅ | The empty set (contains no elements) | ∅={}.
A⊂B | Set A is a subset of B | Every element of A is also an element of B.
A⊊B | Set A is a proper subset of B (subset but not equal) | A is entirely contained within B, but there is at least one element in B not in A.
A∖B | Set difference; elements of A not in B | {1,2,3}∖{2}={1,3}.
A∩B | Intersection of sets A and B | The set of elements common to both A and B.
$\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i$ | Intersection of a family of sets | Elements common to all sets indexed by I.
A∪B | Union of sets A and B | The set containing all elements from both A and B.
$\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ | Union of a family of sets | Set containing all elements from sets indexed by I.
A×B | Cartesian product of sets A and B | Set of all ordered pairs from A and B.
$A_1 \times \dots \times A_n$ | Cartesian product of multiple sets | Set of ordered n-tuples with elements from each set.
