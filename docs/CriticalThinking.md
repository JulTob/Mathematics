## Logic – Finding the Heart of the Argument
### 1. What is the topic?
- Think of the topic as the theme or issue the author is addressing. 
- Ask yourself: What is the author trying to explore or discuss? 
This will help you set the scene for understanding their main message.

### 2. What is the main claim or main message?
- Every argument has a core point – this is the main claim, also called the conclusion or thesis. 
- It’s the big idea the author wants you to believe or accept. 
- Try to put it into your own words: What is the author really trying to say or prove?

### 3. What supporting reasons or assertions back up the main claim?
- Think of these as the pillars holding up the main claim. 
- Ask: What reasons does the author provide to make their main message more convincing? 
- List each reason separately to see how each one contributes to the argument.

### 4. Is there evidence to support the assertions?
- Evidence makes each assertion stronger! 
- Look for facts, examples, expert opinions, or data. 
- Ask yourself: Does this evidence truly support the assertion it’s paired with? and Is this evidence credible and relevant?

## Ethos -- Credibility – Why should we listen to this author?
Evaluating Credibility and Trustworthiness

### 5. Is the author credible? How do you know?
- Look for signs that the author knows their stuff. 
- This could be their background, experience, or expertise in the topic area. 
- Ask: What makes this author trustworthy? and Is the author drawing on credible sources or research?

### 6. Counterargument: Does the piece offer different sides of the argument?
- A credible argument often acknowledges opposing viewpoints. 
- Does the author mention counterarguments? 
  - If so, how do they respond? 
This shows whether the author has considered the full scope of the issue and helps build a balanced argument.

### 7. What is the author’s connection to the issue?
- Ask yourself: Does the author explain their personal or professional interest in the topic? 
Understanding this connection can reveal potential biases or motivations behind their argument.

## Passion
Understanding the Significance and Emotional Appeal: Why should we care? What is the significance?
### 8. What’s the tone of the piece? How does it make you feel?
- Tone reveals how the author feels about the topic. 
- Is the tone engaging, neutral, aggressive, or enthusiastic? 
- Ask: Do I feel like I’m being spoken with or spoken at? 
Tone can influence how persuasive or relatable an argument feels.

### 9. Does the author explain how the issue affects them personally?
- Personal connections often bring out the author’s passion. 
- Look for moments when the author shares how the issue impacts them directly. 
- Ask: Does the author reveal any personal stakes or experiences that make them more invested in this topic?

### 10. Does the author help you feel connected to the issue?
- Effective arguments often make the reader care about the topic. 
- Look for examples, stories, or hypothetical scenarios that make the issue feel real and relevant. 
- Ask yourself: Do I feel more connected to this issue because of how it’s presented?
