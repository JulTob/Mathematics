# Mathematics Topics and Code.

Check the wiki and the [web](https://jultob.github.io/Mathematics) for a complete introduction and theory of the topics.

The code here is complementary to the wiki.

It is based in my notes during high education and teaching.

Some of the topics are:
- Philosophy of mathematics as an introduction
- Arithmetics
- Logic
- Algebra
- Calculus
- Fuzzy Mathematics
- Statistics
- and more!
